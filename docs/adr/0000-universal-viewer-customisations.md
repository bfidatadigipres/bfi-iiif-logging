## Context and Problem Statement

The universal viewer currently has a model for customisation using forked repositories. We need to use BFIs own fork that exists on Github and modify it to track events for this project. We also need a way to deploy the various built assets for the viewer.

## Decision Drivers

* Ease of future customisation for BFI
* Ease of integration for Digirati

## Considered Options

* Submodule the examples repository
* Build components of UV in our solution ([example](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/uv-hello-world))

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Submodule the example repository", because it will keep the application largely agnostic of the viewers that are integrating with it and will reduce build complexity.

### Positive Consequences

* No frontend build considerations
* Updates can be automated with Dependabot

### Negative Consequences

* Universal viewer (UV) submodule contains the built viewer in source control, but this is a pattern of the UV currently.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Submodule the examples repository

This follows a pattern that users of the UV currently follow. The standard examples repository found here: https://github.com/universalViewer/examples is forked and changes made are built and committed to this repository. Some institutions choose to fork the whole [Universal Viewer repository](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer) which itself has a submodule for the examples repository.

This approach will produce a proven and built Universal Viewer instance with required customisations. This repository can then be further customised in a way supported by the wider UV community and used by this solution.

* Good, because it is the standard way in the UV to customise
* Good, because it will be quick to integrate
* Bad, because submodules require updating - but can be mitigated with automation
* Bad, because built code will be in source control in the forked Universal Viewer repository
* Bad, because the Universal Viewer needs to be manually updated and built

### Build components of UV in our solution

This pattern involved installing the Universal Viewer (UV) and all of its dependencies, copying the static assets and then writing our own HTML to bootstrap the page.

* Good, because it will use the latest available version of the Universal Viewer - although this has not always been stable
* Good, because no built assets are stored in source control
* Bad, because the automations will take longer to set up and builds will take longer going forward
* Bad, because the community support is less geared towards these types of customisations.
